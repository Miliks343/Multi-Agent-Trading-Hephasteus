"""Trajectory adapter for the constant-spread baseline.

F runs natively in ABIDES (no PettingZoo), so it never emits an
``info["traj_row"]`` like the env does. This module wraps F to record the
same 6-tuple snapshots once per quote round, then exposes them as a
``Trajectory`` for D's metrics harness.

Snapshot frequency matches F's wakeup frequency (default 10s — coarser than
the env's 1s, fine for Sharpe/MaxDD). One snapshot per successful quote
round; wakeups that skip due to missing L1 data are not snapshotted.
