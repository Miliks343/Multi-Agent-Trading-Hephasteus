"""Replay a suite's saved eval actions through the live quantisation.

Δequity says how much money a policy made; it does not say whether the policy
was making markets. This does. It takes the raw actions written to each eval
trajectory and pushes them through the same rounding that ``actions.py`` applies
before orders reach ABIDES, then reports how often a genuine two-sided quote
actually reached the book.

The distinction that matters: an action vector is not a quote. Offsets are
continuous cents rounded to whole ticks, sizes are rounded to integers, and
``translate_action`` voids *both* sides when the rounded bid would cross the
rounded ask. A policy emitting sub-tick offsets and sub-unit sizes therefore
posts nothing at all while still producing a full-looking action array.

Handles both action layouts. Under the gated layout ``withdrawn%`` is the
share of steps on which the policy *chose* not to quote - a real behavioural
measurement - whereas under the legacy layout not quoting is mostly an
artifact of sub-tick rounding, and ``crossed%`` counts the self-voided steps
that gating makes structurally impossible.
